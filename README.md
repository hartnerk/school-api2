# Create a School API

For this challenge you are going to create an application for a school to help keep track of students and courses. You'll be in charge of the backend, which will be an API that returns JSON. This challenge is pretty open ended. Read through the requirements and work with your partner to create a plan before jumping into the code. What models will you need to create? How will they be associated?

## Release 0 
Set up a new Django project. By now you should be familiar with setting one up from scratch. This project will eventually be deployed to Heroku, so you will need to use Postgres as your database. What do you need to set up so that Django works with Postgres? 


## Release 1 - Students 
Start off by creating CRUD functionality for students. A user should be able to:
- Create new students 
- Read all the students in the school 
- Read data for one particular student 
- Update student records
- Delete a student

You can use Django Rest Framework (DRF) for this, but be sure you understand how it is going to work with nested resources. We did not go over this. You'll need to dig through the docs and do some googling to make sure you know how DRF works and how to get it to set up the correct routes and controller functions. 

You can use the interface that comes with DRF to interact with the database and make sure your routes are working. If you want to stretch your learning a bit, try setting up [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and use it to test your endpoints.

## Release 2 - Courses 
Add the abilitiy to CRUD Courses. A course can have many students and a student can take many Courses. What routes will you need? How can you set up nested routes to be able to get all the students enrolled in a particular course or see all of a student's current Courses? 

You must be able to: 

- Create, Read, Update, and Destory a course 
- Enroll a student in a course 
- Remove a student from a course
- See all the students currently enrolled in a course 
- See all of a student's current Courses 

## Release 3 - Deploy
Deploy your project to Heroku. Follow the steps from today's lesson.
